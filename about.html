          Oak trees are a type of tree that belong to the genus Quercus, which
          is part of the beech family (Fagaceae). There are over 600 different
          species of oak trees, which are found throughout the world, but are
          most common in the Northern Hemisphere.

          Oak trees are known for their hard wood, which has been used for
          centuries to build furniture, ships, and other structures. The leaves
          of oak trees are usually lobed and are a distinctive feature of the
          tree.

          Oak trees are also important for the environment, as they provide
          habitat for a variety of animals and support a range of ecosystem
          services. For example, oak trees are important for soil conservation,
          as their roots help to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Oak trees
          also provide food and shelter for many bird and mammal species, as
          well as insects and other invertebrates.
        </p>

        <p>
          Overall, oak trees are an important part of many ecosystems and have
          played an important role in human history and culture.
